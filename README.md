Insights about what I listen to on a daily basis
https://mindfulmusic.herokuapp.com/

## Motivation

I'm always listening to music. Seriously, always. That's a lot of content consumption. I believe the songs we listen to the most frequently in a short window of time are the ones that have the greatest impact on our mental state and energy. Luckily, the former values are directly correlated to Spotify's 'valence' and 'energy' metric found in each audio track. Compare your daily listens 'happiness' vs their 'energy' and be mindful about your state of being as a result of your music. A simple summary of my top tracks and their musical features chelp me stay mindful and aware of what I listen to on a daily basis.
